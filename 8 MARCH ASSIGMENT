Q1. What is the Probability density function?
ANS. Probability density function (PDF) is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It is used to calculate the probability of a random variable taking a certain value or falling within a certain range of values.

The probability density function is denoted as f(x), where x is a continuous random variable. The area under the PDF curve between two values of x represents the probability of the variable falling within that range. The total area under the curve is always equal to 1, which indicates that the probability of the variable taking any value within the possible range is 1.

The PDF is used in many statistical calculations, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and estimation of parameters. It is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics and is used in various applications, such as in finance, engineering, and natural sciences.


Q2. What are the types of Probability distribution?
ANS. There are several types of probability distributions in statistics, but the most common ones are:

Binomial distribution: A discrete probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.

Poisson distribution: A discrete probability distribution that describes the number of events occurring in a fixed time interval, given the average rate of occurrence.

Normal distribution: A continuous probability distribution that describes data that is symmetrically distributed around the mean, with most values falling close to the mean and few values farther away from it.

Exponential distribution: A continuous probability distribution that describes the time between events occurring in a Poisson process, such as the time between arrivals of customers in a queue.

Uniform distribution: A continuous probability distribution that describes data that is equally likely to fall within a given range of values.

Gamma distribution: A continuous probability distribution that describes the waiting time until a certain number of events have occurred in a Poisson process.

Beta distribution: A continuous probability distribution that describes the probability of success or failure in a binomial experiment, given prior knowledge about the probability of success.


Q3. Write a Python function to calculate the probability density function of a normal distribution with
given mean and standard deviation at a given point.
ANS. import math

def normal_pdf(x, mu, sigma):
    """
    Calculates the probability density function of a normal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation at a given point.
    
    :param x: the point at which to calculate the PDF
    :param mu: the mean of the normal distribution
    :param sigma: the standard deviation of the normal distribution
    :return: the PDF value at the given point
    """
    return (1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))) * math.exp(-(x - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))



Q4. What are the properties of Binomial distribution? Give two examples of events where binomial
distribution can be applied.
ANS. The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has the same probability of success.

The properties of the binomial distribution include:

The trials are independent of each other.
There are a fixed number of trials, denoted by n.
Each trial can only have two possible outcomes, commonly referred to as success (S) and failure (F).
The probability of success for each trial is the same and denoted by p.
The random variable of interest is the number of successes X in n trials.
Examples of events where binomial distribution can be applied are:

Tossing a coin: A coin toss is a classic example of a binomial distribution. Each toss of a coin can only result in two outcomes, heads or tails, and the probability of getting a head is 0.5 (assuming a fair coin). If we toss a coin n times and count the number of times it lands heads, the resulting distribution will follow a binomial distribution.

Q5. Generate a random sample of size 1000 from a binomial distribution with probability of success 0.4
and plot a histogram of the results using matplotlib.
ANS. import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

n = 10  # number of trials
p = 0.4  # probability of success
size = 1000  # sample size

# Generate a random sample from a binomial distribution
sample = np.random.binomial(n, p, size)

# Plot a histogram of the sample
plt.hist(sample, bins=range(n+2), rwidth=0.8)
plt.xlabel('Number of successes')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Binomial Distribution')
plt.show()


Q6. Write a Python function to calculate the cumulative distribution function of a Poisson distribution
with given mean at a given point.
ANS. Here's an example Python function that calculates the cumulative distribution function of a Poisson distribution with a given mean at a given point:

import math

def poisson_cdf(mu, k):
    cdf = 0
    for i in range(k+1):
        cdf += (math.exp(-mu) * mu**i) / math.factorial(i)
    return cdf
The function takes two arguments: the mean of the Poisson distribution (mu) and the point at which the cumulative distribution function should be evaluated (k). It calculates the cumulative distribution function by summing the probabilities of all possible outcomes up to and including k. The formula used to calculate the probability of each outcome is:

Q7. How Binomial distribution different from Poisson distribution?
ANS. The main difference between Binomial and Poisson distributions is the conditions under which they are used.

Binomial distribution is used when there are a fixed number of trials (n), each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure), the trials are independent, and the probability of success (p) is constant for all trials. Examples of events that can be modeled with a binomial distribution include coin tosses, where the probability of getting heads or tails is the same for each toss, and medical trials, where a patient either responds positively or negatively to a treatment.

Q8. Generate a random sample of size 1000 from a Poisson distribution with mean 5 and calculate the
sample mean and variance.
ANS. import numpy as np

# Set the random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(123)

# Generate a random sample of size 1000 from a Poisson distribution with mean 5
sample = np.random.poisson(lam=5, size=1000)

# Calculate the sample mean and variance
sample_mean = np.mean(sample)
sample_var = np.var(sample)

print("Sample mean:", sample_mean)
print("Sample variance:", sample_var)



Q9. How mean and variance are related in Binomial distribution and Poisson distribution?
ANS. In a binomial distribution, the mean is equal to the product of the number of trials and the probability of success in each trial. That is, if X is a binomial random variable with parameters n and p, then the mean is given by E(X) = np.

In a Poisson distribution, the mean is equal to the parameter lambda. That is, if X is a Poisson random variable with parameter lambda, then the mean is given by E(X) = lambda.

In both distributions, the variance is also related to the mean. In a binomial distribution, the variance is given by Var(X) = np(1-p), while in a Poisson distribution, the variance is equal to the mean, Var(X) = E(X) = lambda.

Therefore, in both distributions, the variance increases as the mean increa

Q10. In normal distribution with respect to mean position, where does the least frequent data appear?
ANS. In normal distribution, the least frequent data appears in the tails, which are the extreme values located furthest from the mean. The tails contain a smaller percentage of the data compared to the center of the distribution, which contains the majority of the data. This is because the normal distribution is symmetric, meaning that the probability of a data point being a certain distance from the mean is the same whether it is on the left or right side of the mean.
